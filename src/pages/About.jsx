      "March ended high school, and my brain was officially on vacationâ€”future, a total mystery. But one question kept bugging me: How do YouTube, Facebook, and WhatsApp work? In 9th grade, I discovered programmingâ€”a magical world where you talk to computers and they actually listen!Fast forward to high school: I met C++, a bizarre mix of math and code. When I asked my teacher how to remember it all, she simply said, 'You donâ€™t. You understand it.' Magic, right?  By mid-July, I landed at Chandigarh University, dove into C and C++, andâ€”surprisinglyâ€”loved them. These low-level languages felt like a direct chat with the machine.,And the journey? Well, it had only just begun..",

      "In my second year, I sailed through without any backlogsâ€”what a win! \n\n" +
      "It was an amazing year because I discovered Blockchain and even started playing around with DSA during the third-semester break. \n\n" +
      "Then came the fourth semester, when we had to do a project. We chose blockchain, and thatâ€™s when my blockchain journey truly began. \n\n" +
      "I was so fascinated that I dove right in, but our project needed more than just Blockchain know-how, so I had to learn some frontend as well. \n\n" +
      "My interest in coding pushed me further, and I ended up creating my very first blockchain project, 'Google Drive 3.0.' \n\n" +
      "Yes, that was the name we gave itâ€”oh sorry, I gave it. I was alone with my groupmates. \n\n" +
      "Moral of the story? Choose your project members wisely! ðŸ™ƒ",

      "Oh, you really liked my story? Scrolled all the way here? Nice! So, in 2023, I kept exploring and learned more about Blockchainâ€”finally putting my time to good use (instead of just scrolling memes). To build great apps, I needed great tech, so I dived into the MERN stack. And just like thatâ€”boom! I became a Full Stack Web & Blockchain Developer (sounds fancy, right?). Then came the fun partâ€”building projects that combined web and blockchain. The whole year? Learning, coding, deploying, breaking things, fixing themâ€¦ and repeating the cycle. What a ride! ðŸš€ ",

      "I heard a voiceâ€”wait, was that my heart? Oh yeah, it was. And it had something to say: Hey buddy, remember low-level languages? Itâ€™s been ages, and you havenâ€™t learned a new one! Good point. Thatâ€™s how my love for low-level languages led me to Rust. And let me tell youâ€”what a great, great, GREAT language! By October, I was back in actionâ€”practicing my skills, building new projects, and diving into deep research. The grind was on, and the journey was getting even more exciting! ",

    story:
      "Itâ€™s just the start of 2025, and Iâ€™m back at itâ€”same old routine: learning, practicing, then practicing some more. But after all this time, Iâ€™ve realized one thingâ€”once you get the fundamentals, everything else becomes easy. That's how I was able to play around so much stuff. So, my biggest takeaway? Master the basics, then move forward.Keep learning, keep growing! ðŸš€",

          Currently based in India, a fresh CS graduate, mastering different technologies. Always on the lookout for opportunities, because why settle when you can explore? Skilled in a

          of overthinking. Discipline and punctuality bring me happiness (yes,
          Iâ€™m that person). If something sparks my interest, I have to dive
          inâ€”comfort zones? Never heard of them. I learn, I implement, I break
